            <p><b>Last Updated:</b> 8/28/23 | August 28th, 2023</p>
            <p>Let’s talk about cheap flights. We all know airlines are out to screw us over<br>— and no one wants to be the person who gets stuck paying the highest<br>fare. That’s why we spend hours upon hours researching articles on airfare,<br>trying to game the system like we’re attempting to outsmart a used car<br>salesman.</p>
            <p><a href="#">I’ve written about finding a cheap flight before</a> — and even <a href="#">my process<br>for booking a flight</a> — but today I want to talk about some persistent and<br>inaccurate myths about booking a flight that have stuck around through<br>simple inertia and lazy journalism</p>
